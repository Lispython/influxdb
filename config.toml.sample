# These options specify how data is sharded across the cluster. There are two 
# shard configurations that have the same knobs: short term and long term.
# Any series that begins with a capital letter like Exceptions will be written
# into the long term storage. Any series beginning with a lower case letter
# like exceptions will be written into short term. The idea being that you
# can write high precision data into short term and drop it after a couple 
# of days. Meanwhile, continuous queries can run downsampling on the short term
# data and write into the long term area.

  # split will determine how many shards to split each duration into. For example, 
  # if we created a shard for 2014-02-10 and split was set to 2. Then two shards
  # would be created that have the data for 2014-02-10. By default, data will
  # be split into those two shards deterministically by hashing the (database, serise)
  # tuple. That means that data for a given series will be written to a single shard
  # making querying efficient. That can be overridden with the next option.

  # You can override the split behavior to have the data for series that match a
  # given regex be randomly distributed across the shards for a given interval.
  # You can use this if you have a hot spot for a given time series writing more
  # data than a single server can handle. Most people won't have to resort to this
  # option. Also note that using this option means that queries will have to send
  # all data over the network so they won't be as efficient.
